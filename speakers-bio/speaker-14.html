                    Segun Fatumo is a computational geneticist with a speciality in Genomics of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD) in African Populations. He is the head of NCD Genomics at MRC Uganda and an Associate Professor of Genetic Epidemiology and Bioinformatics at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) UK. Segun Fatumo specialises in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), Polygenic Risk Score Analysis (PRS) and Mendelian Randomisation (MR). He co-led the first major GWAS of cardiometabolic traits in Africa and led the first GWAS of Kidney functions in continental African populations. Segun Fatumo is co-director of the emerging KidneyGenAfrica Research Partnership Programme - A Partnership to Deliver Research and Training Excellence in Genomics of Kidney Disease in Africa. Segun Fatumo is strongly committed to increasing diversity in genomic studies and was recently awarded the prestigious MRC Impact prize for advocating for the inclusion of Africa in genomic research and championing genetic risk prediction of complex diseases in Africa. <br><br>

Segun Fatumo leads the Uganda Genome Resource and co-leads the Nigerian Non-Communicable Diseases - Genetic Heritage Study (NCD-GHS) Consortium - A concerted effort to see over 100,000 Nigerians participate in the eponymous study, which will seek to understand the genetic basis of the highly prevalent non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) in Nigeria such as chronic kidney, diabetes, obesity among others. Segun Fatumo is highly collaborative and involved in major genomics consortia including H3Africa, CKDGen, MAGIC, GBMI, PGC-Africa, IHCC, GLGC and PRIMED/CARDINAL. He is the Founder and pioneer President of the Nigerian Bioinformatics and Genomics Network and the immediate past vice-president of the African Society for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (ASBCB).<br><br>

He is actively involved in capacity building across Africa. He organises and teaches on various genomic analysis workshops in Africa including PhD supervision at Makerere University Uganda, Covenant University Nigeria, the University of Sciences, Techniques, and Technology of Bamako (USTTB) Mali, and the H3Africa Bioinformatics Network (H3ABioNet) node at the Centre for Genomics Research and Innovation, National Biotechnology Development Agency (CGRI-NABDA) in Abuja, Nigeria. Segun Fatumo is a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA) in the UK and teaches on various MSc programmes and supervises PhD students at LSHTM.<br><br>

He has been featured in notable media outlets including BBC, The Telegraph, Wired, Science Magazine, Forbe, Drug Discovery News, etc. He gives regular invited and keynote presentations at major conferences around the globe and serves as an associate editor for high impact journals including Genome Medicine, BMC Medical Genomics, Heliyon, Frontiers in Genetics, PLOS Global Public Health.<br><br>
 
Segun Fatumo received postdoctoral training in genetic epidemiology at the University of Cambridge and Wellcome Sanger Institute and a postdoctoral fellowship in Bioinformatics at the University of Georgia, Athens, USA. Prior to that, He had postgraduate training in applied Bioinformatics at the University of Cologne, Germany and PhD in Computer Science (Bioinformatics specialization) from Covenant University, Nigeria. During his Ph.D. Programme, he developed a model which identified twenty-two (22) potential novel drug targets against malaria, some of which have been tested and validated experimentally.
